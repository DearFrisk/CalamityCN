        LikeNPC_Truffle: "{NCPName} makes me so hungry... I wonder how great of a trip he'd give..."
        LikeNPC_PartyGirl: "{NCPName} would make for a great bartender some day. She really knows how to liven the mood!"
        DislikeNPC_DD2Bartender: "{NCPName} is so bald. Maybe if he'd stop trying to date me he'd finally grow some hair."
        DislikeNPC_TaxCollector: "{NCPName} had best keep his distance... he wouldn't want to wake up one morning with a pipe bomb in his mailbox."
        HateNPC_GoblinTinkerer: "{NCPName} was so terrible that I had to FORCE him to have a better reforge system. Why would you house me next to him? Do you enjoy watching me relive the stress he gave me!?"
        HateNPC_Angler: "{NCPName} never stops blabbering about his inane fishing quests. Get me away from him before I stomp him into the ground!"
        LikeNPC_Princess: You think I’d dislike {NPCName} because we’re too different? Quite the contrary, there's a lot we like to talk about, over non-alcoholic drinks of course.

      {
        Content: I am satisfied.
        NoHome: Thank you for your service, but I am afraid I am without a home now.
        LoveSpace: Ah, the quiet of solitude is something I much enjoy.
        FarFromHome: My scales will dry away from shelter. I am too far from my home.
        DislikeCrowded: The living conditions here are quite cramped, are they not?
        HateCrowded: I disliked leveraging my status but when I was royalty, I was far more accustomed to having less people around.
        LikeBiome: So close to the ocean. It is bittersweet, though I cannot help but like it.
        DislikeBiome: The sun is too harsh on me. I dislike the arid climate here.
        HateBiome: This is simply no place to live. Let us depart immediately.
        LikeNPC: The way {NPCName} acts is a bit too coarse for me, but his love of the ocean is something I can quite appreciate!
        DislikeNPC: I’ve had quite enough carnage for one lifetime thank you! {NPCName}'s destructive tendencies are a bit insensitive.
        HateNPC: "{NPCName} is just a child, but his attitude towards marine life is unacceptable! Absolutely unacceptable!"
        LikeNPC_Princess: That child, {NPCName}. She is an innocent soul. Let us hope the horrors of war never reach her.

      THIEF:
      {
        Content: It’s been going well!
        NoHome: You have a place to bunk? Sleeping on the ground makes me stiff and sore.
        LoveSpace: Less people makes getting away with certain things easier.
        FarFromHome: I need to get back to my secret cache! What if someone got their hands on it while I was away!?
        DislikeCrowded: I don’t like this, too many possible eyewitnesses.
        HateCrowded: Being around this many people makes me think I’M going to be robbed.
        LikeBiome: I know that a lot of wealthy traders come through the desert at times. Makes it a great spot to nick their goods.
        DislikeBiome: Too stifling, too humid. I get sluggish in these conditions, no good.
        HateBiome: No one lives here, and why would they?! This place is a dump!
        LikeNPC: "{NPCName} doesn’t only keep spiky balls in his pockets, he keeps a ton of cash! He’s too absentminded to notice I’m stealing from him too! I like that a lot!"
        DislikeNPC: What a goody two shoes, {NPCName} is! I dislike her out of principle! …And because she has almost no material goods.
        LikeNPC_Princess: I couldn’t bear to steal anything from {NPCName}, she’s so cute!

      WITCH:

        Content: I can’t complain really.
        NoHome: Anywhere would be better than a cave with no bed or lighting.
        LoveSpace: The quieter, the better. This is good.
        FarFromHome: After being used to having people around for a bit, I miss it again.
        DislikeCrowded: I really don’t like how familiar some of these people are getting with me.
        HateCrowded: I’m getting a headache from the pressure of having so many people around.
        LikeBiome: I’ve never had the chance to live somewhere like this before. The trees and the songbirds… I quite like it.
        DislikeBiome: Is this a sick joke? I can’t bear to be here any longer, I’ve already tried to atone for my sins.
        HateBiome: The spirits are unrestful here. It’s really not a good feeling.
        LikeNPC: "{NPCName} is someone who’s had a terrible experience being cursed. He’s put up with it quite well all that time, it’s quite impressive honestly."
        DislikeNPC: Such a racket! All {NPCName} does is make noise, day in and day out! I can’t stand her!
        LikeNPC_Princess: What a strangely pleasant kid, {NPCName} is to be around.

    SCalStartText: You should have just died...
    SCalBH2Text: It wasn't too long ago you barely managed to defeat my doppelganger. Quite the failure, wasn't it?
    SCalBH3Text: You've harnessed great power, but you wield it for no one but yourself.
    SCalBrothersText: Would you like to meet my family? Horrible, isn't it?
    SCalPhase2Text: You will suffer greatly.

    EdgyBossText5: It's not over yet!
    EdgyBossText6: A GOD DOES NOT FEAR DEATH!
    EdgyBossText7: You are no god... but I shall feast upon your essence regardless!
    DoGBossText: The frigid moon shimmers brightly.
    DoGBossText2: The harvest moon glows eerily.

    DraedonExoPhase3Text1: Ever since I was alerted to your presence, I have processed your battles in order to make my machines stronger.
    DraedonExoPhase3Text2: Even now, I monitor your actions. Nothing should escape the bounds of my calculations.
    DraedonExoPhase4Text1: Curious. Very curious.
    DraedonExoPhase4Text2: You progress steadily against more difficult challenges.
    DraedonExoPhase5Text1: Your nature remains unknown to me. This will not do.
    DraedonExoPhase5Text2: ...I sought perfection. Fate must favor irony, for that must have been my first mistake.
    DraedonExoPhase6Text1: Absurd.
    DraedonExoPhase6Text2: I will no longer let my calculations impede my observation of this battle.
    DraedonExoPhase6Text3: I shall show you the full fury of my final machine.
    DraedonAresEnrageText: How foolish. You cannot escape.
    DraedonResummonText: Make your choice.
    DraedonBossRushText: Make your choice. You have 20 seconds.
    DraedonEndText1: An unknown factor-a catalyst is what you are.
    DraedonEndText2: Nearly as alien as I, to this land and its history.
    DraedonEndText3: ...Excuse my introspection. I must gather my thoughts after that display.
    DraedonEndText4: This land has become stale and stiff with blood that has been spilled until now.
    DraedonEndText5: You have also spilled blood, but it may be enough to usher a new age... Of what, I do not know. But it is something I am eager to see.
    DraedonEndText6: Now. You wish to reach the Tyrant. I cannot assist you in that.
    DraedonEndText7: It is not a matter of spite, for I would wish nothing more than to observe such a conflict.
    DraedonEndText8: But you have managed before. You will find a way eventually.
    DraedonEndText9: I must acknowledge your triumph, but I will return now to my machinery.
